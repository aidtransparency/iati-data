# Contributing

If you’ve found an issue with a publisher’s data or metadata, please record it publicly by [creating an issue with IATI data bugtracker](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/issues/new/choose). Anyone can create an issue – you just need a GitHub account.

You can either [create a data issue](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/issues/new?labels=data+issue&template=data-issue.md), or [create a metadata issue](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/issues/new?labels=metadata+issue&template=metadata-issue.md). In either case, a template is provided, asking you for more details about the issue. Please try to provide as much information as you can.

The template will also suggest that you contact the publisher and/or IATI Support, [using this email template](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/blob/main/email-template.md). This is in order to let them know about the problem. This is an important to getting the issue resolved. The bugtracker is merely a public record – it won’t automatically contact the publisher.

Once the issue has been created, a label for the publisher will be added automatically, and the issue will be added to [the project board](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/projects/1) for tracking.

After 30 days of inactivity, a bot will check in, to ask for an update on the status of the issue. If the issue is not resolved after 30 days, it’s moved to the "long-standing issues" column of [the project board](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/projects/1).
