# Contributing

If you’ve found an issue with a publisher’s data or metadata, please record it publicly by [creating an issue](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/issues/new/choose).

You can either create a [data issue](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/issues/new?labels=data+issue&template=data-issue.md), or a [metadata issue](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/issues/new?labels=metadata+issue&template=metadata-issue.md). In either case, a template is provided. Please try to provide as much detail as you can.

The template will suggest that you contact the publisher and/or IATI Support, [using this email template](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/blob/main/email-template.md).

Once the issue has been created, the publisher label should be added automatically, and the issue should be added to [the project board](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/projects/1) for tracking.

The issue will then be bumped every 30 days by a bot, asking for an update on the status of the issue. If the issue is not resolved after 30 days, it’s moved to the "long-standing issues" column of [the project board](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-bugtracker/projects/1).
