**SUBJECT: `SUMMARY OF ISSUE` in `PUBLISHER NAME` IATI data files**

Dear `NAME OF PUBLISHER`,

I wanted to get in touch with you as there appears to be an error in your IATI data.

```
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ERROR
e.g. There appear to be a large number of duplicate IATI Identifiers in your files. It appears that the same activities are being published twice.
```

For example, in this file:
`LINK TO FILE`

```
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ISSUE IN ONE FILE
e.g. In this file, there are 183 activities but only 125 unique identifiers.
```

You can also see this information on the IATI Dashboard for your publisher:
```
PUBLISHER URL ON DASHBOARD, OPTIONALLY WITH BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU CAN SEE THERE
e.g.
http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/publisher/aics.html
You can see here that across all of your published data, there are 7386 activities, but only 5246 of these are unique (the numbers should be the same):
```

All the best

`YOUR NAME`
